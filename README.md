This Fresh Eats exercise was designed to practice devloping a single page website using webpack.
The task was to use webpack and the generated images and specs to create a website for my Fresh Eats client
I resized images, added nav, footer, content, social icons, and Fresh Eats contact info.
I am in the process of building a well designed and responsive website for Fresh Eats...still under construction
